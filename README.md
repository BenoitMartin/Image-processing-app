# Image-processing-app
Python Image processing Project

The subject was : Measuring the thickness of the wall of the carotid artery
Goal : Develop a powerful algorithm to measure the wall thickness of the carotid artery, 
        predictor of arterial stiffness.
        
Input: Snapshots of real'images ultrasound of the carotid artery in jpg format.
Output: thickness of the wall of the carotid artery in pixels

We had to develop an efficient algorithm for segmentation growth regions in the programming language of our choice.
We choose to use python because there is a lot of library for image processing 
and it was an occasion to discover a new language.
